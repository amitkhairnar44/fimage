## Portable Fuchsia Emulator (FImage)
### Note
FImage is provided for the convenience of developers and enthusiasts who don't want to compile Fuchsia.
We are in no way connected to Google. For more information, see [fimage/LICENSE](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fimage/blob/master/LICENSE).

### TL;DR
* The FImage emulator can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fimage/releases).
* For more information on the Fuchsia Emulator, see [this document](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/emulator).

To quickly run FImage, use the commands below inside of it's folder:
```bash
./ffx-linux-x64 platform preflight
./network-config
./fimage-gui 4096
```
### Recommended Requirements
* 8GiB of RAM or more
* an Intel processor produced after 2010 (If you have a dedicated GPU)
* A 4th generation Intel processor (If you do not have a dedicated GPU) 
* Ubuntu 20.04 or equivalent
* curl, unzip,git
* Up-to-date graphics drivers
### Fimage Quick Start
First, download the latest Fimage tool at [fimage/releases](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fimage/releases).
Extract the file `fimage-210525.zip` and go into the fimage folder. 

Begin by checking your hardware, using the provided `ffx` tool. [FFX Documentation on fuchsia.dev](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/tools/sdk/ffx)
```bash
./ffx-linux-x64 platform preflight
```
This will print information about the hardware and software. If you are missing any dependencies or lacking hardware, it will let you know. The most common error is related to a lack of a supported GPU, to negate this, FImage uses software rendering by default, which may affect performance. If you have a supported GPU, use the `fimage-gui-hostGPU` script.

After following the instructions generated by the ffx preflight checks, you will need to configure networking, using the command below. This will configure the network interfaces for FEMU.
```bash
./network-config
```
Finally, the emulator is ready to run! Select one of the different launch options and use that to launch the emulator.

The command syntax is the same for each option. For example, to launch an FImage instance with 4GiB of RAM and a GUI, use:
```bash
./fimage-gui 4096
```
The launch options are as follows:
* fimage-headless - Fuchsia emulator using only the command line
* fimage-gui - Fuchsia emulator with the FEMU interface and the Ermine user shell
* fimage-gui-hostGPU - Same as fimage-gui, using hostGPU; if supported

### Known Issues
* Performance when drawn with the software GPU is expectedly awful
* Mouse input is laggy
* Terminal application within ermine crashes (Fuchsia bug?); negated by pressing enter in the terminal FEMU was launched from.
